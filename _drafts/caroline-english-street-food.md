# Nov 28th, 2018 street food

## street food

the script:

“Hi, guys, today we talked about street food. Street food is food sold out on the streets. Street food has been around for much longer than restaurants have. We call people who sell street food vendors, v e n d o r. A vendor is someone who sells something out on the street. It's usually something that they made themselves. It can be food or some sort of artistic craft. For example, maybe they make homemade soaps or candles. They would also be considered a vendor. Vendors typically sell finger food. Finger food is food that you eat with your hands.

 No silverware needed. The most popular types of street food in the US are tacos, which um, is the type of Mexican food, pizza, hamburgers, popcorn, French fries, that type of thing. Um, in New York city specifically, we also have a lot of smoothie stands. So that's where you um, pick out which fruits you want to combine in a blender and make a drink. We also have a lot of people that sell kebabs, which is chunks of meat and vegetables on a stick. Although the kebab stands in New York for some reason, always smell like they're burning. So I wouldn't particularly recommend those. Anyway,
 street food vendors typically sell their food out of some sort of portable contraption, like a cart or a food truck or a trailer. A trailer is, um, like a small box, basically, that contains like a kitchen. The person stands in it and it's pulled by a truck. Portable means that you can transport it relatively easily anywhere you want to. So for your homework question today, I want you to tell me about your most memorable street food experience. For example, um, my most memorable street food experience was when I was in Costa Rica and I had coconut, so there was well all over the place. There's these people selling uh, coconuts with uh, coconut water.

 And they keep them ice cold and they have a huge machete, and a machete is a giant knife. So they just whack the coconut open, um, to whack means to like hit it hard, uh, with a machete that opens it up. You can drink the coconut water out, and then you hand back to them, they whack it in half, and you can scrape the inside of the coconut and eat the white for depart. Um. It was absolutely delicious, refreshing, all natural, um, and overall a great experience. So that was my favorite street food experience.

Ah, so share yours and I'm looking forward to reading those and going over them tomorrow in our live video portion of class. Have a wonderful day and see you soon.”
